# aws-python-script-collection
A collection of useful python scripts for AWS

## Structure

Each named AWS service folder will have a script generally relevant to that service.

**NOTE** There may be some overlap, EC2 will be used for security groups even though they are generally related to the VPC they are created in etc.
